## 2026-02-26 — Sean initial setup session

- Cloned repo from `https://github.com/Mister-97/mappa-pro.git`
- Created branch `sean/dev`
- Renamed `env` → `.env` (was missing the dot)
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore`
- Changed `PORT` in `.env` from `8080` → `3001` (8080 was already in use locally)
- Server starts successfully on port 3001
- Set up memory system: `FLOWDESK_CONTEXT.md` (high-level) + `memory.md` (detailed changes)
